##**Title**: Airline Customer Segmentation for Tailored Marketing Strategies

**Objective**: The primary goal of this project was to segment airline customers into distinct groups. This segmentation allows for the identification of general customer categories, enabling the development of targeted marketing strategies and offers.

**Approach**:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The first step involved cleaning the dataset by removing null values and irrelevant data. This process ensured that the data fed into the model was accurate and relevant.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Next, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted. This step involved visualizing the data to understand the underlying patterns and trends. It provided valuable insights into the customer behavior and preferences.

3. **Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering**: Given that there was no target variable for this problem, an unsupervised learning approach was adopted. Specifically, the K-Means clustering algorithm was used. This algorithm partitions the customers into 'k' clusters, where each customer belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

4. **Optimal 'K' Determination**: The optimal number of clusters ('k') was determined using the Elbow Method. This method involves plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.

**Outcome**: By completing these tasks, you've successfully segmented the airline customers into distinct groups. This segmentation can now be used to develop targeted marketing strategies and offers, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and business profitability. üëè
